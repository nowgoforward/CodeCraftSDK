CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:1 (project):
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
